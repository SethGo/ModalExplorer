# ModalExplorer
Synthesizer arpeggiators typically allow the electronic musician to create melodic content (playing one note
          at a time) using a selected subset of notes from the available range. I created the Modal Explorer as a
          proof-of-concept digital prototype that provides a functional augmentation to the standard arpeggiator. The
          musician can now iterate through the resulting harmonic structures (multiple notes at a time) created by
          setting scale and inversion parameters.
